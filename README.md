Description:
A Battle Royale mode made for MW3. It features gameplay similar to Call of Duty: Online's style of Battle Royale. You select your spawn location and spawn with no gun. You must find guns spread around the map. The last player standing wins.

Notes:
There is memory modification in this script used to modify the raw damage values of weapons used. These addresses were made according to my server's memory. The addresses may not work on a different server because of this. They must be custom coded in order to work on your setup.
